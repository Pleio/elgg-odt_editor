1. Get wodotexteditor-x.y.z.zip from http://webodf.org/download/ (location as of 0.5.5)
2. Unzip somewhere
3. Replace "vendors/wodotexteditor" with the complete "wodotexteditor" subdir from the unzipped download
4. Apply patches from "vendors/patches/wodotexteditor" (include binary diffs)

   First check if any of the patches have been merged upstream and remove them if.

   The patches ideally would be applied in this order
   1. addDownloadButtonOption.patch
   2. hideAboutDialog.patch
   3. addReadonlyMode.patch
   4. takeUILanguageFromElgg.patch
   5. addSaveAsOption.patch

   "git apply vendors/patches/wodotexteditor/*" would apply them in one go.
